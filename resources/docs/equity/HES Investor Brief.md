# 🗳️ Investor Brief
### Hybrid Election System (HES)

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

**Hybrid Election System (HES)** is a revolutionary civic-tech initiative addressing the transparency, integrity, and cost-efficiency issues in Philippine elections. By combining **computer vision-based ballot appreciation** with a **blockchain-ready open-source returns system**, HES enables secure, verifiable, and citizen-observable vote counting — in real time.

We are seeking **₱100,000,000 in seed capital** to fund the development, deployment, and nationwide awareness campaign for the Hybrid Election System. This investment will allow us to execute a pilot in 300 precincts and position the platform for COMELEC adoption by 2028.

## 💡 The Problem

- **Opaque election systems** result in widespread public distrust.
- Current **Automated Election Systems (AES)** are expensive, hard to audit, and vulnerable to internal tampering.
- **Spoiled ballots** and voter disenfranchisement are common.
- Lack of **citizen-level visibility** during vote counting.

### Key Innovations:
- 🎯 **Ballot Appreciation™**  
  Computer Vision-based real-time ballot reading using standard webcams or mobile cameras.

- 🧠 **TRUTH Engine**

  Compatible with household-grade printers and scanners.

  Human-readable ballots + digital counts shown on-screen.
