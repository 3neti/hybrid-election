If there is a **Change of Control**, IPO, or sale of substantially all assets before an Equity Financing, the SAFE will convert into the number of common shares equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the valuation cap price per share — or the Investor may elect to receive a refund of the Purchase Amount, whichever is greater.
